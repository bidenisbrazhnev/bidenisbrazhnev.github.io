    <h2>My life</h2>
    <p>I was born on a cold december night in 2004. Then, when I was 4 years old, I learned the main differences between a rifled cannon and a howitzer. Neat, right? My first official major achievement came when I was 10 years old. I won third place on a national english competition. The year after, I won third place on a national biology competition, and fourth place on an international english competition. In 2017 i joined a mountaneering club. I am still a member of the club, however i do not have the time to be quite active. My biggest achievements in mountain-climbing are: vertically ascending ~2600 meters in 5 hours at Olympus when i was still rather inexperienced; climbing the highest peak in the balkans, Musala; completing the "Skopje-Vodno-Matka" tour three times; climbing prominent peaks in Macedonia such as Solunska glava, Carev vrv, Lisec on Osogovo, Kajmakcalan... My favourite climb is when we hiked from Popova Sapka to Titov vrv. It was also the longest hike in distance, some 30 kilometres long. 2017 was also the year I joined the scouts. I have had lots of camps with them, mostly in Ohrid, and all of them were a terrific time! In the meantime, I had won some more "awards" on competitions, including: three third places on national biology competitions, three third places on national english competitions, several third and second places on regional mathematics competitions, and lots of second and third places on national and international judo competitions. My robotics team, of which I was the co-captain, won second place on a national competition and twentieth on the following international one. However, my biggest and most prized achievement came in 2019. On the way back from the robotics international competition held in Celje, Slovenia, I found out that I had been chosen as one of the three students who would recieve a full scholarship in "NOVA" international schools! That had been my wish since seventh grade, and I knew that getting a full scholarship would be the only way my family and I could afford it. So, folks, there ya' have it, my academic life so far!</p>
